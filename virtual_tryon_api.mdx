# Overview

The Virtual TryOn API provides developers with the capability to integrate our try-on model directly into their applications. Built on a RESTful architecture, it currently supports only HTTP endpoints.

## Base URL

The base URL for the Virtual TryOn API is:

```bash
https:/<API-Host>/vton/request
```

[Go to the API reference](/api-reference/virtual-tryon-api/tryon-request)

## Authentication

Access to the Virtual TryOn API is secured through the use of API keys.

### API Key Usage

Include your API key in the request headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure:

| Code | Description                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 200  | Success - Request completed successfully         |
| 400  | Bad Request - Invalid parameters or missing data |
| 401  | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key        |

# API Parameters Guide

## Model Image

**image URL | base64**

`model-image` refers to the source image of the individual on whom the virtual try-on will be applied. This image can be submitted either as a publicly accessible URL or a base64-encoded string.

<img src="/images/model-image.webp" alt="Model Image Example" />

## Garment Image

**image URL | base64**

`garment-image` is the visual representation of the clothing item intended for virtual try-on with the `model-image`. You can provide this input either as a direct image URL or as a base64-encoded string.

<img src="/images/garment.webp" alt="Garment Image Example" />

Virtual Tryon accepts multiple garment photo formats including flat-lay, ghost mannequin, or model-worn images.

**Garment Fit Examples**

## Category

**string**

`category` identifies the type of garment present in the `garment-image`. This guides the virtual try-on engine in selecting the appropriate region to apply the clothing. For images with multiple items (e.g., top and bottom), use this to prioritize the desired garment.

Default: `auto` â€” automatically infers the garment type.

| Value      | Description                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| auto       | Automatically determines the garment category |
| tops       | Shirts, blouses, t-shirts                     |
| bottoms    | Pants, jeans, skirts                          |
| one-pieces | Dresses, jumpsuits                            |

## Mode

**string**

`mode` determines the balance between processing speed and output quality.

| Mode        | Description                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| performance | Optimized for speed; fastest response time (~2-3s)                |
| balanced    | A compromise between speed and quality (~3-5s)                    |
| quality     | Prioritizes high-quality results; takes longer to process (~5-8s) |

## Moderation Level

**'conservative' | 'permissive' | 'none'**

`moderation_level` controls how strictly the API filters garment images for content sensitivity. The default is `permissive`.

- `conservative`: Filters out revealing garments. Recommended for modesty-sensitive use cases.
- `permissive`: Allows most garments including swimwear and underwear, while rejecting explicit nudity.
- `none`: Disables all content filtering. Use with caution.

## Segmentation Free

**boolean**

`segmentation_free` controls whether the system skips explicit garment segmentation.

- `true`: Enables direct garment fitting without isolating clothing.
- `false`: Enforces clothing segmentation. Use if artifacts from the original garments interfere with results.

## Output Format

**'png' | 'jpeg'**

`output_format` defines the desired image format for the generated try-on result.

- `png`: High-quality output with no compression loss.
- `jpeg`: Faster response with mild compression. Better for real-time use.
